## Technical Requirements
Performing - The app contains 3 models with 1 association. I encourage you to flesh out the functionality for users. Setting up authorizations through your user model. You got the CRUD functionality for posts and comments pretty solidly.

## Creativity and Interface
Progressing - I like the color scheme and it looks clean. How can we take more steps to make this your own? I think given enough time you could easily polish up this app to get it to a point you want it stylistically. As it stands right now the home page routes you to sign up, but there's really no reason to .. yet.  I definitely encourage you to keep working on this project for the meet & hire and more importantly your portfolio.

## Code Quality
Progressing/Performing - While the code is pretty well formatted there are a couple minor hiccups in that department. The biggest concern I have is the lack of comments in your code base. Add comments to places in your code that were challenging so that you don't have to reread code to get a bearing on what's going on. Instead you could just look at a comment. Additionally, future you will be much happier with past you on well commented code.

## Deployment and Functionality
Progressing/Performing - The deployed version of this application gets an error as soon as I click on the signup button. Not sure what's causing the error without looking at the logs. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but the user model isn't doing anything yet. That's ok, I think you just need to add some associations and change the CRUD a bit based on the associations.


## Planning/Process/Submission
Progressing - As it stands, all I have in the way of planning is some user stories. That said, there are some important aspects of planning that I'm sure you did but didn't document. Any ERD's and initial wireframes would be great in the planning folder. Additionally the readme could use some setup instructions as well as the ERD.

## Overall
I'm really happy with the progress you've made from Unit 1 to Unit 2. You seem to have the model CRUD down. Keep it up! The next steps are seeing how you can manipulate this structure/patterns to fit your own molds. There is still lots more to learn. I encourage you to keep working on this project and get it portfolio ready by the end of the course.
